I am an early career researcher at the University of York, UK, where I am completing my PhD in neuroscience with 
[Prof Jonny Smallwood](https://twitter.com/the_mindwanders){:target="_blank"} and 
[Prof Elizabeth Jefferies](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=9OBIArkAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}. 

My research interest involves the application of machine learning bridging neuroimaging measures and complex traits such as intelligence. 
My current research concerns the patterns of functional whole-brain neural hierarchy and its relationship with on-going thought and other high-level cognitive functions with multivariate analysis, such as canonical correlation analysis and principal component analysis. 
I hope to further examine the population level cognitive traits uncovered in large neuroscience datasets at individual level.

I am a self-taught programmer and enjoy math. As a psychologist by training, I combine my interests in programming and game design with psychology to optimize experiment design and building more reusable framework with PsychoPy for my lab. You can find my work on my [GitLab repository](https://vcs.ynic.york.ac.uk/haoting/){:target="_blank"}. 

In my free time, I enjoy video games, tabletop role-playing games, cooking and weightlifting. I think about game design a lot and ocassionally write stories. Recently, I am trying to learn chess and guitar.
