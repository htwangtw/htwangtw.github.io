# Who am I?

I am a postdoctual researcher at the University of York, UK, working with 
[Prof Jonny Smallwood](https://twitter.com/the_mindwanders){:target="_blank"}. 

# What do I do?
My research interest involves the application of machine learning bridging neuroimaging measures and complex traits such as intelligence. 
My current research concerns the patterns of functional whole-brain neural hierarchy and its relationship with ongoing thought and other high-level cognitive functions. I specialise in multivariate analysis, such as variations of canonical correlation analysis and principal component analysis. I hope to further examine the population level cognitive traits uncovered in large neuroscience datasets at the individual level. 

I am a self-taught programmer and enjoy math. As a psychologist by training, I combine my interests in programming and game design with psychology to optimize experiment design and building a more reusable framework with PsychoPy for my lab. You can find my work on my [GitLab repository](https://vcs.ynic.york.ac.uk/haoting/){:target="_blank"}. 

In my free time, I enjoy video games, tabletop role-playing games, cooking, and olympic weightlifting. I think about game design a lot and occasionally write stories.
