I am an early career neuroscientist at the University of York, UK, where I am completing my PhD with 
[Prof Jonny Smallwood](https://twitter.com/the_mindwanders){:target="_blank"} and 
[Prof Elizabeth Jefferies](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=9OBIArkAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}.

My current research concerns the patterns of funcitonal whole-brain neural hierarchy and its relationship with on-going thought and other high-level cognitive functions.
