I am an early career neuroscientist at the University of York, UK, where I am completing my PhD with [Prof Jonny Smallwood](https://twitter.com/the_mindwanders) and Prof Elizabeth Jefferies.

My current research concerns the patterns of funcitonal whole-brain neural hierarchy and its relationship with on-going thought and other high-level cognitive functions.
