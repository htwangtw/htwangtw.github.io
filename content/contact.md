I am happy to chat about my projects, collaborations, code, and data.
Free free to reach me through any channels that you can find in the panel on the left, 
email,
or [brainhack mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) (@haoting).

I hope the messages to be respectful and effective, 
and I aim the same in my replies. 
When contacting me, 
please refrain from using titles when addressing me and super formal language.
My name will do.
However, do not hesitate to let me know how you would like to interact with others, 
including the level of formality, preferred name, and your pronouns.

By default I would like to have the meeting in English.
Although I can speak Mandarin Chinese, I am not great at speaking it in work context.
If you would prefer to have a meeting in Mandarin Chinese, please let me know in advance.
I will do my best to accommodate. 

If you spend more than 30 minutes to articulate the content, 
a quick chat might be what you need.
You can also use the form below to book a meeting with me. 
It is synced to my calendar. 
I will contact you if anything comes up that requires the meeting to be rescheduled.
