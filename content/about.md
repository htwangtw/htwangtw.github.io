I completed my PhD at the University of York, UK, 
with [Prof Jonny Smallwood](https://twitter.com/the_mindwanders){:target="_blank"}.

My current research focuses on brain connectivity-based biomarker discovery through machine learning.
I am passionate about data infrastructure and software engineering in scientific research.
My open source contribution includes, but not limited to: 
neuroscience and machine learning software Nilearn, cca-zoo, and pydra workflow task pydra-fsl.

You can also find me at brainhack events.
I have recently hosted the [OHBM Hackathon 2022 in Glasgow, UK](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2022/){:target="_blank"}

When I am not doing research, I spend a lot of time in the kitchen.
I am a recreational Olympic weightlifter affiliated with [club Les Géants de Montréal](https://geantsdemontreal.com/).
I like video games and TRPG. 
Not doing them as much as before but still loves chatting about these topics.
