I am a [Canadian Neuroanalytics Scholars](https://www.albertaneuro.ca/first-cohort-of-canadian-neuroanalytics-scholars-announced/) in
[laboratory for brain simulation and exploration (SIMEXP)](https://github.com/SIMEXP) 
at [Montreal Geriatrics Institute (CRIUGM)](https://criugm.qc.ca/), 
working with [Prof Lune Bellec](https://github.com/pbellec/).
I completed my PhD at the University of York, UK, 
with [Prof Jonny Smallwood](https://www.thinclab.ca/).

My current research focuses on brain connectivity-based biomarker discovery through machine learning.
I am passionate about data infrastructure and software engineering in scientific research.
You can find out more about my research and open source contribution on my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/htwangtw).

When I am not doing research, I spend a lot of time in the kitchen, and I have a lot of opinion about groceries.
I am a recreational Olympic weightlifter affiliated with [Club d'haltérophilie Les Géants de Montréal](https://geantsdemontreal.com/).

Last updated: 15 May 2025

Hao-Ting Wang earned her Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging from the University of York, United Kingdom, in 2019. 
Under the guidance of Professors Jonathan Smallwood and Elizabeth Jefferies, 
her research specialisation focused on applying multivariate statistical methods in cognitive neuroscience.
During her Ph.D., she conducted work using sparse canonical correlation analysis to explore the neurocognitive foundations of mind wandering, 
utilising resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and experience sampling. 
Her research provided a comprehensive guide on applying canonical correlation analysis in brain-behaviour association studies. 
It has accumulated 200+ citations since its publication in 2020.

<!-- Following her doctoral studies, Hao-Ting secured a Sackler Research Fellowship at the Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science (now the Sussex Centre for Consciousness Science). 
In this role, she investigated the correlation between brain activity and physiological signals. -->

Currently, Hao-Ting serves as a postdoctoral researcher at Centre de recherche de l’institut universitaire de gériatrie de Montréal (CRIUGM) in
[laboratory for brain simulation and exploration (SIMEXP)](https://github.com/SIMEXP) 
at [Montreal Geriatrics Institute (CRIUGM)](https://criugm.qc.ca/), 
working with [Prof Lune Bellec](https://github.com/pbellec/).
She received a fellowship from the Institut de valorisation des données (IVADO) in 2022 
and subsequently the [Canadian Neuroanalytics Scholarship](https://www.albertaneuro.ca/first-cohort-of-canadian-neuroanalytics-scholars-announced/) in 2025
to work on fMRI foundation model for biomarker discovery for neurodegeneration. 
She aims to create a foundation model of fMRI data with graph convolution networks (GCN) for biomarker discovery for neurodegenerative diseases. Her work integrates diverse clinical datasets to enhance clinical predictions and disease progression. 

The open-source tool is an anchor of her research. She contributes to developing technical standards within the Python ecosystem for neuroimaging research. 
Her contributions include projects such as nibabel, Pydra, fMRIPrep, phys2bids, the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), and Nilearn. 
As a core developer of Nilearn, a widely used neuroimaging machine learning library, 
she offers expertise in fMRI data processing utilities and guides the overall direction of the Nilearn community. 
Additionally, she is a dedicated advocate for the BIDS ecosystem, actively developing software aligned with BIDS application standards.
The effort leads to a fully reproducible [fMRI denoising benchmark](https://doi.org/10.55458/neurolibre.00012) using open datasets and BIDS-compliant software.
