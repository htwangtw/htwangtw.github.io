I am a postdoctoral researcher in
[laboratory for brain simulation and exploration (SIMEXP)](https://github.com/SIMEXP) 
at [Montreal Geriatrics Institute (CRIUGM)](https://criugm.qc.ca/en/about-us/who-are-we/), 
working with [Prof Lune Bellec](https://github.com/pbellec/).
I completed my PhD at the University of York, UK, 
with [Prof Jonny Smallwood](https://www.thinclab.ca/).

My current research focuses on brain connectivity-based biomarker discovery through machine learning.
I am passionate about data infrastructure and software engineering in scientific research.
My open source contribution includes, but not limited to: 
neuroscience and machine learning software Nilearn, cca-zoo, and pydra workflow task pydra-fsl.
You can find out more about my research and open source contribution on my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/htwangtw).

You can also find me at brainhack events.
I have recently hosted the [OHBM Hackathon 2022 in Glasgow, UK](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2022/)
as the [OHBM Open Science Special Interest Group Hackathon cochair](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2022/team/).

When I am not doing research, I spend a lot of time in the kitchen.
I am a recreational Olympic weightlifter affiliated with [club Les Géants de Montréal](https://geantsdemontreal.com/).
