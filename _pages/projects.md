# Research Projects
## Heterogeneity of ongoing thought
My PhD thesis explored the patterns of functional whole-brain neural hierarchy and its relationship with ongoing thought and other high-level cognitive functions with sparse canonical correlation analysis.
We identifies the differenet within network connectivity patterns within the default mode network related to different type of experience and are linked to unique functional outcome. 
At the whole-brain level, the attention and perception related regions are pivioting system of directing cognitive resorces during ongoing experience.

My current research will continue to investigate the whole-brain patterns as a continuous gradient related to the ongoing thought. 
I will also take a closer look to the contribution of the attention and visual sysetem in creating a internal mental state unrelated to the external world.

## Reusable experiement framework with Psychopy


I have been working on a reusable experiemnt framework based on Psychopy. 

The core of this framework is the separation of experiment design and stimuli delivery. 

Example project coming soon.
