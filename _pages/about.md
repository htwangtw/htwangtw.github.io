I am a postdoctoral researcher at Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science, University of Sussex, UK, working with
[Prof Hugo Critchley](https://www.bsms.ac.uk/about/contact-us/staff/professor-hugo-d-critchley.aspx){:target="_blank"} and [Prof Sarah Garfinkle](https://twitter.com/DrSFink){:target="_blank"}.
I completed my PhD at the University of York, UK, with [Prof Jonny Smallwood](https://twitter.com/the_mindwanders){:target="_blank"}.

My research involves the application of machine learning bridging neuroimaging measures and complex traits such as intelligence and clinical diagnosis.
My current research concerns the patterns of functional whole-brain neural hierarchy and its relationship with ongoing thought and other high-level cognitive functions.
I specialise in multivariate analysis, such as variations of canonical correlation analysis and principal component analysis.
I hope to further examine the population level cognitive traits uncovered in large neuroscience datasets at the individual level.

I am good at learning tools to make my research more reproducible.

When I am not doing research, I spend a lot of time optimising my Sunday roast recipe.
I am a recreational Olympic weightlifter but never intended to compete.
I am very passionate about bike commuting and following traffic rules.
I like video games and TRPG.
